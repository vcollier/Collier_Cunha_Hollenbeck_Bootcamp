                <h3>The Client,</h3>
                <p>The TRAA came to us looking for a more user friendly, simplistic website. Immediately we had a vision of what we wanted the site to look like. Sticking with the branding that was already set in stone, we kept the earthy tones from images that they provided for us and just modernized the overall feel.</p>

            <div>
                <h3>Typography,</h3>
                <p>Another thing the team really wanted to focus on was the typography. This was one thing that the previous website was lacking. Typography is one of the main components to a modern website and if done incorrectly, can make the branding seem unprofessional.</p>

                <h3>Images,</h3>
                <p>Images play a huge role in grabbing the viewers attention. The team ultimitly decided to go with black and white images, simply because otherwise they were too distracting. Most pictures from the TRAA are candids and did not have a cohesive theme.</p>

                <h3>Quotes,</h3>
                <p>TRAA is a local association, looking to better the environment. Topics like these are very personal and sensitive. We decided to put some quotes into the final design to make it feel more personal for the viewers.</p>
