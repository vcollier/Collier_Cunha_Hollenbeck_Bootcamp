# Welcome to Boing Designs.

### Boing

The website was designed and developed is such a way to really express what our company is all about.

Want to see our past work? or just curious about what we do? You can find it all on this website!

Boing has been an offical agency for a year and half with three partners; Victoria, Renata and Keiran. The three of them met at Fanshawe College and all had the same vision for a future company. The three of them wanted to create new, innovative designs to really up the norm for website and application design.
